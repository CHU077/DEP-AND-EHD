# DEP-AND-EHD
Large-scale study of depression and EHD among Chinese adolescents using multilevel and network analysis.
All analyses were conducted in R (version 4.4.2), using publicly available packages. Multilevel modeling was performed using lme4, car, sjPlot, and ggplot2; network analysis was conducted using glasso, qgraph, bootnet, and igraph. All packages are open-source and referenced in the Methods. No custom code beyond standard implementation was used in model building. Selected R scripts for generating figures are available here.
